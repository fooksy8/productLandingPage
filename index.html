<h2 >The Fitting Process</h2>
<h3>1. The Interview</h3>
<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JCdAEZXXZsE/maxresdefault.jpg" id="fittings-img" alt="Interview-pic">
<p>You fitting will begin with your fitter obtaining important information. Questions help the fitter identify your ball-flight tendencies, equipment specifications, your likes and dislikes about your current set and your needs and preferences from new equipment. The dialogue will continue throughout the fitting to ensure that your expectations are being met every step of the way.</p>
<h3 id="static-measurement">2. Static Measurement</h3>
              <img  src="https://forum.mygolfspy.com/uploads/monthly_09_2012/post-224-080473500%201348060010.jpg" id="fittings-img">
              <p>After the initial interview, the fitting will continue with the fitter determining your initial club specifications based on your preferences, needs and ability. For drivers, fairways and hybrids, you'll discuss the general performance characteristics of different models, lofts and shafts. For an iron fitting, your height and wrist-to-floor measurement are taken to help calculate your static iron colour code (lie angle) and shaft length and your hand dimensions are used to calculate your static grip colour code, or grip size.</p>
              <h3 id="dynamic-swing-test">3. Dynamic Swing Test</h3>
              <img src="https://www.golfswingsystems.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-03-11-14.13.33.jpg" id="fittings-img">
              <p>For an iron fitting, you will hit a few golf balls from an impact board with special tape on the sole of the club. When the club hits the board, it will leave a mark on the tape that helps the fitter better understand how your setup, posture and swing affect the clubhead’s position at impact. The fitter then makes adjustments to arrive at your colour code. 
For drivers, fairway woods and hybrids, face tape or spray is applied to the face and the impact marks are analysed for consistency to determine the optimal shaft length. </p>
<h3 id="ball-flight-analysis">4. Ball-Flight Analysis</h3>
<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.8e0e6707e20c7daea282376d71a20fe2?rik=Tm1yU2nUh5drmA&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.golfalot.com%2fPortals%2f0%2fimagesblogs%2fping%2fs55review%2f7address.jpg&ehk=6xB%2bDOywDgu7xlSDoe3p4zSa4I9kIo3WITbrc2VN2MA%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" id="fittings-img">
<p>Your fitting will offer some degree of ball-flight analysis from the driver through the wedges. The fitter will utilise a variety of clubs with slightly different specifications to isolate each fitting variable. This process helps determine the combination of model, loft, colour code, shaft length and flex, and grip that gives you the best opportunity to achieve your optimal ball flight.</p>
